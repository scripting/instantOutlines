# ioServer

The server that connects all instant outlines to editors and readers.

### Background

The ioServer app has been around in one form or another for about 15 years. 

I started taking notes here on 9/30/2020.

The map is going in a MySQL database.

The outline map, that associates an instant outline url with an outline, is in the stats struct. 

It should at least be in its own file, if not in a sql database. 

Instead of serving an outline, we redirect to littleoutliner.com. 

I'm doing a backup now, to preserve the previous version. It's also <a href="https://github.com/scripting/ioServer">on GitHub</a>.
